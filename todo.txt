roms_extract
	support for multiple saves per roms file

roms_extract
	cell array of all inputs after filename--list of extractions to do per file

roms_extract
	be clever about not loading full variable more than once


rethink roms_createRunDef

remove obs_mooring code

switch to native netcdf
	move roms_averageFileSet_native and roms_godinfilt_native
	should roms_extract preserve the dimension order that snctools delivers, or reverse everything?
	
in obs_extract,
the files in the master data archive should all be given a string variable
or attribute called "contact" that gives an agency/program and a person
(someone who can answer methodology questions and either give permission 
to use the data in a paper, or forward a request to someone who can)
