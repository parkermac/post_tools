make roms_extractFromFile use roms_extractFromVariable

rethink roms_createRunDef

switch to native netcdf
	move roms_averageFileSet_native and roms_godinfilt_native
	should roms_extract preserve the dimension order that snctools delivers, or reverse everything?
	update: Parker, Sarah, and Neil determined that the snctools dimension order is preferable, and this means that switching to native netcdf may not provide any speedup, since every large extraction would require an annoying rearranging step afterwards.
	
roms_extract
	support for multiple saves per roms file;
	cell array of all inputs after filename--list of extractions to do per file (?)

in obs_extract,
the files in the master data archive should all be given a string variable
or attribute called "contact" that gives an agency/program and a person
(someone who can answer methodology questions and either give permission 
to use the data in a paper, or forward a request to someone who can)
