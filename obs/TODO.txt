* keep track of the file each data point is taken from.

	[extraction, filenames] = obs_extract(...
	extraction has a new field, .fileid, which is an integer index into
	_filenames_, a cell array of the files that data was found in


* obs_omit.m should take a ones-and-zeros array the same size as fields like
	x, y, etc as input, in place of the string.
	
	this will make it possible to do things like
	ex = obs_omit(ex, find(ex.t < 0 & ~isinsalishsea(ex.x,ex.y)))


* obs_extract.m should take the syntax

	...,'section', track, range);
	where _track_ is a structure with fields .x and .y.
	if a field .dist is also found in _track_, then this is used instead of
	what comes out of trackDist (a convenient way of shifting the origin).
	
	
* move utility functions like dirwalker (anything the user isn't intended to
	call directly) into psvs/utility, out of psvs/obs.
	
	
* trackDistnew should _replace_ the older trackDist in psvs/utility and just
	be called trackDist.
